1. So in file Angular.json we added bootstrap and check all csss files imported in head element on inspection.
2. iNDEX.HTML IS SERVED by server. which includes <app-root. component and that how our application starts.
3. @Component is called decorator. 
4. There will scripts imported if you inspect your page, those scripts are substitied by gn-serve and includes our code as well. 
Our code gets triggered from main.ts onwards. this bootstraps our main app.module.ts which in turn provides way for our components to be executed.
In there is a list of bootstrap components which are then to be analyzed while initial serving of index.html.

Thhus angular gets starts main.ts which bootstarps our application (which is a module: module.ts, and is passed as argument) and withing this module
 we bootstrap our component that angular should know. Which this main component, we have our main selector which is used in index.html.
